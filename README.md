- 👋 Hi, I’m @ephraimicarus

- 👀 I engineer quality sofware solutions in order to make the world a better place. In my opinion, the world gets better as we advance and use technology "the right way"
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that solve real-life problems, make peoples work easier and, in turn, allow them to have more free time to enjoy life

- I have learned a lot so far and am now eager to showcase my skills!

- P.S Since my 9-5 is a software developer job ( :computer: :smile: ) , I have neglected my GitHub presence :disappointed:. But, I have more free time now and am trying to get back on track :roller_coaster:
